# What the Web offers to scientists

 - Support for collaboration

 - Computation as a service

 - Publication

 - Cloud storage and computing

 - Social networks

 - Other services

---

# Collaboration

 - [GitHub](http://github.com/) - you have used it yourself.
   [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) provides similar services.

 - Collaborative computation (e.g. [coLaboratory](http://colaboratory.jupyter.org/)).

 - Collaborative editing/note taking: [Etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/),
   [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/)

 - Mozilla Science's [Collaborate](http://collaborate.mozillascience.org/)
   network aims to create collaborations on scientific software.

 - Problem-oriented sites such as [polymath](http://polymathprojects.org/)
   invite anyone to contribute to the solution of scientific problems.

 - Crowdfunding sites such as
   [experiment.com](https://experiment.com/) or
   [SciFlies](http://www.sciflies.org/js.html) bring together
   researchers and funders for small but innovative projects.

 - Distributed computing projects [SETI@home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/), [Folding@home](http://folding.stanford.edu/) ask for volunteer contributions
   of computing resources.

 - [Citizen Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) invites
   the public to participate in research projects.

# Computation as a service

 - Simple principle: you upload some data, enter some parameters, push
   a button, and download the result.

 - Often provided by research groups to encourage adoption of their
   methods. Evaluate their claims critically.

 - Sometimes provided by universities primarily for educational purposes.

 - Sometimes provided by research institutions as a community service.

### Watch out

 - A computational service may disappear at any time.

 - Or it may update its software and produce different results.

 - Some services do not explain the methods they apply in detail.

 - Don't upload confidential data.

**_Use_** Web services, but don't **_depend_** on them if you can avoid it.

# Computation as a service

### Randomly picked examples from my field of research

 - [2Struc](http://2struc.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/): secondary structure
   of proteins

 - [LIPS](http://tanto.bioe.uic.edu/lips/): prediction of
   helix-lipid interfaces

 - [WEBnm@](http://apps.cbu.uib.no/webnma/home):
   Normal Mode Analysis of proteins

### Graphics and visualization

 - [plotly](https://plot.ly/): plots and charts

 - [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/): plots and charts

 - See this [list](http://datavisualization.ch/tools/selected-tools/)
   which also covers libraries for Web programmers

# Publication

 - Preprint servers: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/), [bioRχiv](http://biorxiv.org/)

 - [Authorea](http://www.authorea.com/), [SciGit](http://www.scigit.com/),
   [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): collaborative writing of
   scientific publications.

 - Citable publication of datasets, figures, software, ...:
   [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/), [figshare](http://figshare.com/)

 - Publishing datasets of unlimited size:
   [Academic Torrents](http://www.academictorrents.com/)

 - Publication of executable code with datasets:
   [Exec&Share](http://execandshare.org/)

---

# Presentations

### Web services

 - [Slideshare](http://slideshare.com/) for sharing presentations

 - [SlideWiki](http://slidewiki.org/): on-line editor for collaborative
   editing of presentations.

### Tools for Web-based presentations

 - [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com/) - what I use for these slides

 - [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)

 - [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) - particularly interesting
   for use with [Browsercast](https://github.com/twitwi/deck.browsercast.js/)

# Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

 - Permanent identifiers for digital publications.

 - Used by all scientific journals for referring to articles.

 - [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) and [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
   assign a DOI to each published dataset.

 - DOI lookup: http://dx.doi.org/

### Why not simply use a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)?

 - URLs identify a storage location, DOIs identify the data

 - DOIs are permanent:
   - it is impossible to change the digital object referred to by a DOI
   - DOIs are meant to be valid "forever".

---

# Cloud storage and computing

 - Backup storage for data: [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/),
   [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/), ...

 - Scientific computing: [OSDC](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/),
   [Red Cloud](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/redcloud/),
   [Wakari](https://wakari.io/)

 - Virtual machines and large-scale data storage:
   [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/),
   [Google Cloud Platform](http://cloud.google.com/)

---

# Social networks

 - [Academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/)

 - [Mendeley](http://www.academia.edu/)

 - [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/)

 - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

# The future of scientific research

 > _Prediction is always uncertain, especially if it concerns the future._
 > [*attributed to various famous people*](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/)

Scientific research is changing faster than ever before. Computing
and Web technologies play an important role in this change.

 - [Reinventing Discovery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691148902/ref=as_li_tf_tl?tag=michaniels-20) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/), and his [TEDx talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now) on Open Science show realistic scenarios for the evolution of science.

 - A more technical [book](http://book.openingscience.org/) on Open Science
   looks into many aspects in detail.

 - A [EU consultation](http://scienceintransition.eu/) demonstrates that
   science funders are taking these changes seriously.

 - A big open question is how this will change scientific careers.

 - Another big open question is the future of public funding for science.
