# Reproducibility in science

 - One of the ideals of science: any competent scientist who repeats your
   work should reach the same conclusions.

 - "Repeating" can mean several things:

   1. Exact replication of every single step.
   2. Applying the methods described in a publication, using similar
      but not exactly identical equipment and samples, and
      "filling in the blanks" for unpublished details.
   3. Designing a different study following the same general principles,
      which *should* lead to the same conclusions according to the
      accepted state of knowledge in the field.

 - In experimental science, 1. is not an option: exact replication
   is technically impossible.

 - In computational science, 1. is possible but difficult.

 - Any effort towards replicability improves confidence into the
   results.

# The reproducibility crisis

 - Reproducibility and replicability are hot topics in science today,
   as more and more cases of error and fraud are discovered.

 - A [meta-study on medical research](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) concluded in 2005 that "most published research findings are false".

 - A [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPYzY9I78CI) from
   2014 by that study's author provides a broader and up-to-date view
   of the problem.

 - *Nature* discusses the topic regularly. The articles are
   grouped in a [Nature special](http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/) entitled "Challenges in irreproducible research".


---

# Replicability of computational science

 - In computational work, replicability should be perfect, because
   computation is deterministic. Just record everything and play it
   back later.

 - In practice, computational science is _less_ replicable than
   most experiments.

 - The problem: recording _everything_ is very difficult:

   - all the input data: local files, database downloads, ...
   - all the software, including OS, compilers, ...
   - all interactive input,
     including every single mouse click!

 - Better infrastructure support for replication is a current
   research topic. (Here's [my contribution](http://www.activepapers.org/),
   with a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.5773.1) providing
   some background.)

# Adopt a best-effort approach

Making your work 100% replicable for eternity is not a realistic
goal right now. But you can probably do better than what you are
doing now.

### Replicating your own work on your own computer

Goals:

 - know exactly how every figure in your thesis/paper was produced:
   from which data, using which computational steps
 - if any dataset or program changes, update everything that depends
   on it *automatically*

This is the topic of today's session.

### Keep track of what you do

 - Use version control for all your research data.
 - Write down the versions of all software that you use.
 - Prefer open-source software to proprietary packages.
 - Get and read the papers that describe the computational methods you use.

# Workflow management

### Scripting

A simple approach for workflows that do not take much time: write a script
in your favorite language that does _all_ the computations.

### Command-line workflow managers

 - [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/):
   The oldest and most widely used one,
   originally designed for software build processes.
   A bit messy, just like git.

 - [Sake](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/)
   and [Drake](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)
   are recent developments specifically for data workflows.
   They still have some rough edges, and are not quite
   trivial to install, they but are worth exploring.

### Graphical workflow managers

 - [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/)
 - [Kepler](http://kepler-project.org/)
 - [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/)
 - [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page)

# The Unix command line toolkit

 - Lots of programs with cryptic names and cryptic parameters,
   optimized for rapid typing.

 - Each tool does one task and does it well.

 - Designed to work together.

 - Most tools work with text files or text streams.

 - The output of one tool can be used as the input of another one
   without creating an intermediate file.

 - It’s easy to write a special-purpose tool that integrates with the
   standard tools.

Unix is a family of operating systems that was created in the
1970s. It includes Linux and MacOS X.

The Git for Windows installation contains most of these tools as well.

# Getting started

 - `man <command>` shows you the manual for a command

 - `apropos <keyword>` lists commands whose manual contains the keyword

 - Start by looking at `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `rm`, `file`, `od`, `cat`

Rather than list commands here, I will switch to live demonstrations!

---

# Pipelines

Chain of commands in which the output of each command is fed into the
next one as input.

Examples:

 - `ls -l | more`

 - `grep '^ATOM.*[[:space:]]CA[[:space:]]' 3KYH.pdb | wc -l`

 - `cat <file> | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq`

---

# I/O redirection

Output redirection: write to a file instead of the terminal (more
precisely: “standard output”)

Example:

    ls -1R > all_my_files

Input redirection: read from a file instead of the terminal (more
precisely: “standard input”)

Example:

    tr ' ' '\n' < <file> | sort | uniq

---

# Regular expressions

 - search patterns for text

 - used by `grep`, `awk`, and by many text editors

 - very powerful, rather cryptic: takes time to master

 - check out [this tutorial](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)

Examples:

 - `books?` matches `book` and `books`

 - `gr[ae]y` matches `gray` and `grey`

 - `\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b` matches any valid e-mail address

The last example shows how complex regular expressions can beome.

# Getting started with `make`

There are many `make` tutorials written for software developers.
Google `make tutorial` will give you a large choice.
[This one](http://www.linuxforu.com/2012/06/gnu-make-in-detail-for-beginners/)
is a reasonable start for our purposes.

The [GNU make
manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html)
tells you everything you ever wanted to know about `make`, plus a lot
more. The [O'Reilly book](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/make3/book/index.csp) about make is also a good resource for learning.

## Concepts and jargon

**Makefile**: a file defining a workflow. Contains a sequence of _rules_.

**Rule**: Defines how to make a _target_ given its _prerequisites_
          by applying _recipes_.

**Target**: the result of a step in the workflow. This can be the name of
            a file that will be produced, or some arbitrary label.

**Prerequisite**: targets that need to be made before the current rule
                  can be applied.

**Recipe**: a shell command that can contain _special variables_.

---

# Rules

A rule has the form:

    target ... : prerequisites ...
            recipe
            ...
            ...
**Every recipe line must start with a tab character!**

---

# Examples

_Example 1:_

    overview.html:
            wget http://rawgithub.com/khinsen/FdV-ScientificComputing-2015/master/overview.html
This rule creates the file `overview.html` by downloading it from the
GitHub repository for this course.

_Example 2:_

    slide_count: overview.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- overview.html | dc -e '? 1 + p' > slide_count
This rule counts the number of slides in `overview.html`.

---

# Special variables

On the last slide, the recipes repeated the filenames given as targets or
prerequisites. This can easily lead to mistakes (changing the name in one place
but not in the other), and it prevents generic rules (next slide).

This is why `make` proposes its _special variables_, which stand for
filenames or parts of them:

 - `$@` full name of the current target
 - `$<` name of the first dependency
 - `$^` names of all dependencies, separated by spaces
 - `$?` the dependencies that are newer than the target

Our examples can be rewritten as

    overview.html:
            wget http://rawgithub.com/khinsen/FdV-ScientificComputing-2015/master/$@

    slide_count: overview.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- $< | dc -e '? 1 + p' > $@

---

# Patterns

It is possible to define rules for categories of targets using
_patterns_. A pattern contains a single `%` symbol that stands
for any text string.

_Example_:

    %.slide_count: %.html
            grep -c ^\\-\\-\\- $< | dc -e '? 1 + p' > $@
This rule says that any target whose name ends in 
`.slide_count` can be made from a file with the same name
but extension `.html` using the given recipe.

Obviously, patterns _require_ special variables. There is one more
of those:

 - `$*` the text that corresponds to `%` in the target

---

# Today's exercice problem

**Goal**: for a given PDB code, check if the crystal structure
lacks any residues.

**Approach**:

 - download the PDB structure file
 - download the corresponding FASTA file containing the sequence
 - count how often each residue type occurs in the structure
 - count how often each residue type occurs in the sequence
 - compare the counts to see if anything is missing in the structure

Write a `Makefile` that provides these five steps, and lets you
run any of them individually.

Use whatever tools you know/like in the recipes, including whatever
your favorite programming language is.

Test your methods using one structure that is complete (e.g. 193L)
and one structure that isn't (e.g. 3KYH).

**Bonus version**: if this is too easy for you, try to do it
using only standard command-line tools from the Unix world.
Good candidates are `cut`, `diff`, `fold`, `grep`, `sed`, `sort`, `tr`,
and `uniq`.

# Downloading files from the PDB

Use either `wget` (Linux) or `curl` (MacOS):

    wget http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/3KYH.pdb
    wget http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do\?fileFormat\=fasta\&structureId\=3KYH -O 3KYH.fasta

    curl http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/3KYH.pdb > 3KYH.pdb
    curl http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do\?fileFormat\=fasta\&structureId\=3KYH > 3KYH.fasta
